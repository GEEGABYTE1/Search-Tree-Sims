# Search Trees 🌴🔎

Simple organized view of traversing a search binary tree to return a certain value. 

Users can also traverse a min heap or max heap, however, values must be inputted manually into the program. 

Both Heaps (min and max) have all base functions, the `.traverse()` function must be kept in order to traverse the heap. 

The Tree uses a *Breadth-First Search* Algorithm to Search values. Both space and time complexity are `O(N)`. This algorithm can look for a value in any type of tree with any amount of children under a parent node, making the algorithm very versatile in searching values in different types of trees, and not just binary tree. 

# Extra info 

The Bfs algorithm will return a the path of the search value and will print additional annotations.
